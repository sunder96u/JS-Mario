# Endless-Mario-JS
Created an endless Mario level using Javascript

The goal of this project is to create a randomized Mario level utilizing Javascript.
I will be using the JQuery Library

Game Play:
Controls:
    Left Arrow -> move to the left
    Right Arrow -> move to the right
    Up Arrow -> Mario Jumps
    Down Arrow -> Mario Ducks
    A -> move to the left
    D -> move to the right
    W -> Mario Jumps
    S -> Mario Ducks


Game Play:
    Get as far as you can in an endlessly self generating level
    The goal is to get as far as you can in the level
    The will currently be no power-ups, player will always be small mario
    If Mario:
        Falls into a hole, game over
        Hits an enemy, game over

Game Creation:
    I am hoping to build an RNG based level when the player enters the level.
