# Endless-Mario-JS
Created an endless Mario level using Javascript

The goal of this project is to create a randomized Mario level utilizing Javascript.
I will be using the JQuery Library

Game Play:
Controls:
    Left Arrow -> move to the left
    Right Arrow -> move to the right
    Up Arrow -> Mario Jumps
    Down Arrow -> Mario Ducks
    A -> move to the left
    D -> move to the right
    W -> Mario Jumps
    S -> Mario Ducks


Game Play:
    Get as far as you can in an endlessly self generating level
    The goal is to get as far as you can in the level
    The will currently be no power-ups, player will always be small mario
    If Mario:
        Falls into a hole, game over
        Hits an enemy, game over

Game Creation:
    I am hoping to build an RNG based level when the player enters the level.
    

I would like to credit:

When creating this project, I used https://openhtml5games.github.io/games-mirror/dist/mariohtml5/main.html. I changed some folder name, and some variable names. I kept most Class and Constructor names as they provided a great description of what they did. I did also keep generic variable names such as x, y, length, width, height and these provided a great description of what they did. I changed the game from a map based mario game, to an endless adventure with rotating backgrounds after each stage ended. I updated the formate of all pages except character.js, enemies.js, and spriteCuts.js to ES2015 formating, I kept those as they were to prevent issues
